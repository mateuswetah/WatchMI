# Wearable Braille

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Wearable Braille input prototypes with different interaction methods. This project holds Braille Input layouts to be tested on a Smartwatch.

So far **User Study** and **Demo Apps** sessions are not implemented. In **Just Try** session, 4 inputh methods can be found:
 - _Touch_: Simple buttons layout, similar to [BraillÉcran](https://github.com/mateuswetah/BrailleEcran)'s logic.
 - _Swipe_: Directional implementation. Swiping from any point of the screen to a certain direction activates the Button arranged into that direction.
 - _Pressure_: [WatchMI]((https://github.com/tcboy88/WatchMI))'s Pressure, adapted for activating a button once the blue line enters the button region. 
 - _Serial_: Adapted from the concept of [TypeInBraille](http://www.everywaretechnologies.com/apps/typeinbraille). Instead of the three-finger click for skiping a line or confirming the character, a Swype to Top is used here.

Forked from [WatchMI](https://github.com/tcboy88/WatchMI) project.
