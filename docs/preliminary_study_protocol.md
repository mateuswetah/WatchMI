# Preliminary Study Protocol

### Introduction

Volunteer's information collection

 * Name, Age, Onset blind age, Profession
 * Experience with Braille
 * Experience with Smartphone and Smartwatches
 * Known methods for text input in daily routine (perkins, QWERTY+TalkBack, Speech Recognition, etc.)

Explanation of project's motivation, hypothesis and ideas

### Prototypes feedback first contact

Demonstration of each of the proposed configurations on the Touch prototype:

1. Tone Generator for dot activation feedback
2. Vibration Pattern for dot activation feedback
3. 3D tactile surface for better spatial recognition
4. Screen rotation to better attend user's arm disposition

Ask volunteer, regarding the four above:

* How would you rank it's usefulness? (Likert 5)
* Justify choices and suggest changes.

### Prototypes experiment and analysis

Explanation and demonstration of each of the other five prototypes, speaking out-loud to volunteer which dot is being activated, using Braille's number codification, or on-screen position, as he or she prefer. Ensure maximum clarity in this step to guarantee a good comprehension

For each of the six prototypes, allow free interaction/exploration. Identify and observe difficulties and errors.

Ask to volunteer, regarding each of the six prototypes:

1 - Totally disagree; 2 - Partially disagree; 3 - Neutral; 4 - Partially agree; Totally disagree;

* I understood clearly how the method works (Likert 5) 
* I fount the method easy to learn? (Likert 5)
* I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with. (Likert 5) 
* I feel that I could type fast with this method. (Likert 5)
* I feel that I could type without errors in this method. (Likert 5)

Ask volunteer to rank prototypes, order them in terms of preference and offer final thoughts on  positive and negative aspects of each one. 

###  Conclusion

Gather suggestions for improvements/fixes on the current project.

Gather suggestions for future features (delete action, full-sentence-listen action, suggestion-words action,  etc).
