# User Report 1

### Introduction

 * Name: TÃ¡lita Serafim Azevedo.
 * Age: 24 years old.
 * Blindness acquired when 3 years old.
 * Braille learned when 7 years old.

Uses computer with DosVox screen reader for Windows.

Uses smartphone with Talkback for Android.

Had used Perkins keyboard when in college, donated the machine specially for being too heavy.

Uses headphone constantly when listening to feedbacks, specially for a matter of privacy.

Recently graduated on Portuguese, her final thesis highlights the importance of Braille for her independence.

###Extra Interaction Features

I find this feature useful for my usage (Likert 5)

1. Tone Generator: Totally Agreed
2. Vibration Patterns: Partially Disagree
3. 3D tactile surface: Partially Agree
4. Screen Rotation: Neutral

Vibrations were argued to be too much information to handle. The default vibration, although is essential.  Tone generator had a very positive feedback.

If, in case of 3D tactile surface usage, user suggests an experience similar to TalkBack, where user would first click to locate dot, then press. User also affirms that, even for a first use, she prefers to compose the Braille cell that to use QWERTY keyboard, mentioning how close letters are in a small screen of a smartphone, for example. 

### Prototypes experiment and analysis

Responses on affirmations using a Likert scale of 5, where:

1 - Totally disagree; 2 - Partially disagree; 3 - Neutral; 4 - Partially disagree; 5 - Totally agree 

#### 	Touch

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 5
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 4
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 5
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 3

Overall evaluation of use: Good.

User had difficulties when using swipe as a confirmation method, as it was rarely correctly recognized. Despite that, user feels that method is more practical than QWERTY.

#### Swipe

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 4
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 5
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 3
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 1

Overall evaluation of use: Bad.

User considers the idea good but implementation is not functional, as swipes detections fail in majority.

#### Connect

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 5
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 5
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 3
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 5

Overall evaluation of use: Good

Suggestion: allow deactivating button when passing by it a second time.

#### Pressure

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 4
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 2
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 4
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 1

Overall evaluation of use: Very bad

#### Serial

- I understood clearly how the method works: 1
- I found the method easy to learn: 1
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 1
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 4
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 1

Overall evaluation of use: Very bad

#### Perkins

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 5
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 3
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 5
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 2

Overall evaluation of use: bad

Method works better when using rotated screen. One of the reasons noted are that the non-clickable area is bigger on top and bottom part of screen, generating more errors on double tap detections.

### Final preference order

1. Connect
2. Perkins
3. Swipe
4. Touch
5. Serial
6. Pressure

###  Suggestions and Observations

Connect method was chosen as favorite for having more chance of working. As user does not need to take finger of screen during cell composition, it has a better notion of space, without loosing reference.

For future features, user suggests double-tap interactions (as familiar for talkback users), and having confirmation and erasing actions as directional opposites.
