# User Report 2

### Introduction

 * Name: LÃ­lian Cristina do Santos.
 * Age: 39 years old.
 * Born blind.
 * Braille learned when 5 years old.

Uses computer screen reader for Windows.

Uses smartphone with Talkback for Android and a small physical keyboard via bluetooth.

Extremely used to QWERTY physical keyboard, as being a professor on online courses.

Uses headphone sometimes when listening to feedbacks.

Reports strong association with braille using numbers (thinks of the letters as a combination of their code)

###Extra Interaction Features

I find this feature useful for my usage (Likert 5)

1. Tone Generator: Totally Agree
2. Vibration Patterns: Partially Disagree
3. 3D tactile surface: Totally Agree
4. Screen Rotation: Neutral

Vibrations were argued to be useful only if typing slow and patiently. Probably, with more practice, could prove useful, but at first contact it's hard to differentiate.  Tone generator had a very positive feedback.

### Prototypes experiment and analysis

Responses on affirmations using a Likert scale of 5, where:

1 - Totally disagree; 2 - Partially disagree; 3 - Neutral; 4 - Partially disagree; 5 - Totally agree 

#### 	Touch

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 5
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 5
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 5
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 5

Overall evaluation of use: Good.

User also had difficulties when using swipe as a confirmation method, as it was rarely correctly recognized.

#### Swipe

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 2
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 1
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 2
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 2

Overall evaluation of use: Very Bad.

User could use almost nothing of the prototype, as swipe gestures detection failed aggressively.

#### Connect

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 5
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 5
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 5
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 5

Overall evaluation of use: Very Good

Even not being obligatory, user started clicking on buttons quickly instead of only drawing (which works due the timeout). User believe that the lack of timeout action improves the method speed and forces her to produce dots quickly. In this method, user also noticed how used she already was to dot's layout and position, performing very good results when composing words.

#### Pressure

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 2
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 1
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 2
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 2

Overall evaluation of use: Very bad

User argues that it is needed to perform too many movements to compose a cell, can be exhaustive.

#### Serial

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 4
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 2
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 2
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 2

Overall evaluation of use: bad

Despite taking a good time to understand method, user argues how hard it is to identify which line is being composed. A feature request would be to speak the current line. Problems of swiping are inherited here.

#### Perkins

- I understood clearly how the method works: 5
- I found the method easy to learn: 5
- I was able to clearly identify which dot I was working with: 4
- I feel that I could type fast with this method: 5
- I feel that I could type without errors in this method: 4

Overall evaluation of use: neutral

Method works better when using rotated screen. User argues that method takes a while to understand, but once is got, it makes a lot of sense. Only complain is to provide a better way to identify which column is being inserted.

### Final preference order

1. Connect
2. Touch
3. Perkins
4. Serial
5. Pressure
6. Swipe

###  Suggestions and Observations

Provide simpler gestures, avoid swipes.

User highlights the importance of Braille for being main way for reading outside of technological environments, such as reading medicaments in a pharmacy. 

User affirms that at first, considered that 3D surface would be essential to use any method, but later noticed how quick she was able to get used with the positions of the dots in the small screen. She feels confident that methods like connect can provide typing even faster then what she can do nowadays with QWERTY keyboard in smartphones.

User also argues that some methods could be learned better with more contact and certainly provide better experience than the first contact acquired in this interview.
